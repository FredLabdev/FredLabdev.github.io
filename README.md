- Solution URL: []
- Live Site URL: [https://fredlabdev.github.io/]

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- GitHub

### What I learned

I learned to construct polylines svg elements (before to find svg files in /images folder...) <= Think about improving my reading of the data of a problem !

### Continued development

I ran out of time or rather organization, to set up the project in a structural way (CMS, PHP or MVC architecture). I focused on the design aspect, according to what I understood from the essentials asked in this test.

### Useful resources

[Bootstrap template] (https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-homepage) - This dedicated bootstrap template helped me save time, not especially for the construction of the homepage, but to lay the foundations for a responsive architecture, notably in anticipation of the shop page of this e-commerce site.

[Bootstrap carousel] (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/carousel/) - Built-in bootstrap carousel functions saved me time for the HP slider.

[svg line/polyline] (https://jsfiddle.net/opeaucelle/692rkz90/) - Helped me to build responsive and vectorial arrows (Not necessary but what is done is done and allways usefull !)
